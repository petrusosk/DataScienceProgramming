# DataScienceProgramming
Course work programming for DS - preproccessing, modelling, metrics etc. 

The work has been conducted within the 'Programming for Data Science' course at KTH, Royal Institute of Technology, in collaboration with David Happel and Albin Bååw.

The work is beneficial for preprocessing, transparent models, and evaluation metrics. The project report is an example of developing a predictor on a binary classification problem with a imbalanced data set.
